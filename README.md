# Cocoserver

> An independant implementation of a Conan server

Cocoserver is a server for [Conan] packages,
or a [_remote_][remotes] in Conan parlance.
From the perspective of a Conan client,
it is meant to be a drop-in replacement for [Artifactory].

Cocoserver works by using free public storage: 
a GitHub branch for recipes, and [Filen](https://filen.io/) for
conan binaries
